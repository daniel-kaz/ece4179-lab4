    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are also introducing transforms to the image datasets. This concept is covered in the workshops, and [here](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) is the pyTorch documentaion about transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will give you some guidance on how to implement the transforms in this lab  but keep in mind that this concept and implementation will be critical for the assignment later on. The transforms we will use are mainly (\"ToTensor()\" and \"Normalize()\") which we have used in the workshop. Now in addition to the usual transforms, we will be adding __data augmentation__ as well. The ones we have included are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- RandomHorizontalFlip()\n",
    "- RandomRotation()\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what is **data augmentation**? Data augmentation in deep learning refers to the process of artificially diversifying a dataset by applying various transformations and modifications to the existing training examples. The objective of data augmentation is to enhance the model's generalization capability and robustness by exposing it to a wider range of variations and scenarios that might be encountered during real-world inference. These transformations can include rotations, flips, translations, changes in lighting and contrast, cropping, and more, depending on the nature of the data. By introducing this augmented data during training, the model becomes better equipped to handle novel and previously unseen examples, effectively reducing overfitting and improving its ability to extract meaningful features from noisy or imperfect inputs. Data augmentation has become a fundamental technique in deep learning, contributing significantly to the improved performance of neural networks across various tasks, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why do we only apply augmentation to the training set? Data augmentation is specifically applied to the training set and not the test set because the purpose of data augmentation is to introduce diversity and variation into the training examples, helping the model to generalize better to real-world scenarios. The test set serves as an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. If data augmentation were applied to the test set, it could lead to overly optimistic performance estimates, as the model would have already seen similar augmented examples during training, potentially inflating its apparent accuracy."

    "Now, what is a confusion matrix? A confusion matrix is a fundamental tool in the field of machine learning used to assess the performance of a classification model. It provides a comprehensive tabular representation of the model's predictions by categorizing them into four key outcomes: true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "    \n",
    "True positives indicate the instances where the model correctly predicted a positive class, while true negatives represent correct predictions of the negative class. False positives occur when the model wrongly predicts a positive class as negative, and false negatives signify incorrect predictions of the negative class as positive.\n",
    "    \n",
    "By visually summarizing these prediction results, the confusion matrix enables you to derive various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which offer deeper insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses across different classes, aiding in the evaluation and refinement of its predictive capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will visualize the ability of the network to classify the images in the test set by using a slightly more complex confusion matrix, ie, a confusino matrix for multiclass classification.
